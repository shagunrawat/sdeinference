To reproduce the convergence figure (Figure 1) from the paper,
follow these steps:

1) From this directory, run the following command:

Rscript runner.R > runner.out

This should create allresults_j.RData for j=1,2,4,5,6.

2) Enter the cpp directory and each of the ex# directories for #=1,2,4,5,6.

Repeat the following steps for h=0.005,0.002,0.001:
(1) Edit the iterate.cpp file to set the value of h appropriately
(2) Build the executable:

make

(3) Run the C++ code and redirect output to a file:

./iterate > solution_#_h

for example, if #=5 and h=0.001, then the command would be:

./iterate > solution_5_0.001

There should be a total of 5*3 = 15 runs of this C++ code.

3) Now get back to this directory and run

Rscript newerrcomb.R

Should create newallresults_j.RData for j=1,2,4,5,6.

4) Create the convergence plots for j=1,2,4,5,6.

Rscript plotter.R

5) Take care of the j=3 special case.

Rscript runner2.R > runner2.out
Rscript plotter2.R

You should now have convplot_j.eps and convplot_j.pdf for j=1,2,3,4,5,6.
